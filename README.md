2D elastic transversely isotropic equation of motion for heterogenious media. Sharp boundaries are treated following (Mizutani, 2000)

A0B0A1B1triso.m	- Muzitani Boundary conditions
curveintersect.m - curve intersections
dkr.m - kronecker symbol
func_p_find_closest_grid_nodes.m - find grid points near the boundary
getByteSize.m - check size of the variable
monitor_memory_whos.m - check total memory consumption
svdinv.m - SVD pseudo-inversion
tester.m - useful test functions
tr_iso_2d_disp.m - MAIN
voigt.m - Voigt mapping that moves 4th order tensor to 2nd
